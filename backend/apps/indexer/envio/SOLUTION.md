# 🎯 Simple Solution - Skip Envio for Now

## Current Situation

- `envio init` replaced DeleGator.AI config with ERC20 template
- PostgreSQL not installed (needed for local Envio)
- Database connection failing

## ✅ Recommended Approach

**Skip Envio integration for the hackathon demo** and use your existing NestJS indexer instead.

### Why?

Your existing indexer already works:
- ✅ `backend/apps/indexer/src/listeners/chain-listener.service.ts` - Polls for events
- ✅ `backend/apps/indexer/src/processors/event.processor.ts` - Processes events
- ✅ Already integrated with your PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Already triggers BotWorker
- ✅ No additional setup needed

### What to Do

**Option A: Use Existing NestJS Indexer (Easiest)**

Just run your backend normally:

```bash
cd backend
npm run start:api
npm run start:bot  # In another terminal
```

Your existing indexer will:
- Poll blockchain for events
- Process them
- Trigger rebalances
- Store in PostgreSQL

**Option B: Deploy to Envio Cloud (If you want GraphQL API)**

```bash
cd backend/apps/indexer/envio

# But first, we need to restore DeleGator.AI config
# (The current files are ERC20 template)
```

## 🚀 For Your Demo

**Just use the existing NestJS indexer!** It works and requires zero additional setup.

Envio would be nice-to-have for:
- GraphQL query API
- Faster real-time indexing
- Better developer experience

But it's **not required** for your hackathon demo to work.

## If You Want to Add Envio Later

After the hackathon, you can:
1. Install PostgreSQL
2. Restore DeleGator.AI Envio config
3. Run `npm run dev`

Or deploy to Envio Cloud for hosted solution.

## 📝 Summary

**For now:** Use your existing NestJS indexer (already working!)

**Later:** Add Envio for GraphQL API and better performance

**Your app will work perfectly without Envio!** 🎉
